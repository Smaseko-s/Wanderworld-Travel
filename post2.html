    <p>Traveling doesn’t have to break the bank. With a bit of planning, you can explore amazing destinations while keeping your wallet happy. Here are our best budget travel tips for 2025.</p>

    <h2>1. Plan Ahead</h2>
    <p>Book your flights early to get better prices. Set alerts on apps like Skyscanner or Google Flights to track fare drops.</p>

    <h2>2. Travel Off-Season</h2>
    <p>Visit destinations when tourist traffic is low. You’ll save on flights, hotels, and enjoy a more relaxed experience.</p>

    <h2>3. Choose Affordable Destinations</h2>
    <p>Countries like Thailand, Portugal, and Vietnam offer incredible value for money, with cheap food and stays.</p>

    <h2>4. Stay Smart</h2>
    <p>Use hostels, guesthouses, or even homestays. They’re cheaper and often more authentic than hotels.</p>

    <h2>5. Eat Local</h2>
    <p>Skip tourist restaurants. Eat where locals eat — street food can be both delicious and affordable!</p>
