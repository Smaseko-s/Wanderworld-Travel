    <p>Timing your travels right can make all the difference — from better weather to fewer crowds and cheaper prices. Here’s when to visit some of the world’s most popular cities.</p>

    <h2>1. Paris, France</h2>
    <p>Visit in April–June or September–October for mild weather, fewer tourists, and beautiful gardens in full bloom.</p>

    <h2>2. New York City, USA</h2>
    <p>Spring and autumn offer the perfect balance of warm days and crisp evenings — plus amazing events like the NYC Marathon.</p>

    <h2>3. Tokyo, Japan</h2>
    <p>March and April are cherry blossom season — a stunning time to experience Japan’s culture and beauty.</p>

    <h2>4. Cape Town, South Africa</h2>
    <p>November to March offers the best beach weather, but April–May is perfect for wine tours and fewer crowds.</p>

    <h2>5. Rome, Italy</h2>
    <p>Go in late spring or early autumn for comfortable weather and shorter lines at famous landmarks.</p>
